        <div class="about-p">My name is Alexa. I was born in Illinois, in the city of Geneva. From a very early age, my dad would teach me how to do math. He would print out all these sheets of multiplication to help me get ahead of my peers. It helped me learn a little, but I wasn’t very good at it. One of my mom’s previous jobs involved storing painting supplies at a self-storage facility. It made me so excited when she would come home with paintbrushes and canvases. We would paint together—I loved painting landscapes. Of course, I wasn’t an expert at painting, I wasn’t very good at it—but I loved it. <br><br>

          Just three years ago, I was enrolling in community college after I had just earned my high school diploma. <br><br>


          My dad always told me, <br>
          “There aren’t many women in the engineering field. You will have a great opportunity for a career if you pursue engineering.” <br><br>

          I wasn’t very good at math. I wanted to pursue art. Both my parents supported my decision when I found myself interested in graphic design. I enrolled into the graphic design program at College of DuPage. Ever since I started, graphic design has been my passion. It allows you to express yourself and communicate the meaning of the piece of work through visuals. I never imagined myself in the graphic design world, but it truly helped shape who I am now.
